    <p style="text-align: justify;">1.2 Any reference in these Conditions to any statute or provision of a statute shall be construed as a reference to that statute or provision as amended, re-enacted or extended at the relevant time and any regulations made there under from time to time.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. APPLICATION AND BASIS OF CONTRACT</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Contract shall constitute the entire agreement between BALCONETTE and the Buyer in respect of the supply of the Goods to the exclusion of all other terms and conditions (including any terms or conditions which the Buyer purports to apply under any purchase order, confirmation of order, specification or other document).</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. ACCEPTANCE</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Buyer&#39;s Order shall be deemed to incorporate these Conditions. If the Buyers Order states any condition or term not specifically included herein it shall not be deemed to be accepted by BALCONETTE unless and until confirmed in writing by an authorized representative of BALCONETTE.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. PRODUCT DRAWINGS</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">4.1 Where the Buyer wishes to purchase Goods from BALCONETTE the following procedure shall apply:</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) After receipt of the Buyer&#39;s Order BALCONETTE will liaise with the Buyer and produce specific drawings for authorisation and signature by the Buyer;</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) The Buyer will approve the drawings by one of three ways, sign them, email acceptance, or tick approval on the website; thereby confirming that the Buyer has checked all the information &amp; specifications to confirm they are correct and satisfactory and conform to their requirements - material, structural and legal;</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) No alteration or change can be accepted on the drawing/s. Any amendment must be incorporated into the drawing/s and resubmitted for signature. In the case of approval of drawing on the website, the BUYER will receive an email confirmation with the approved drawing/s and will have the opportunity to review these again. If the BUYER discovers any error they will be required to contact BALCONETTE immediately to abort manufacture, reasonably within one business day.&nbsp;</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">(d) Once approved drawings cannot be altered and manufacture will be deemed to have taken place per the drawings. Any alteration will require a new Buyer Order.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">4.2 All patterns, drawings, designs, samples and specifications submitted by the Buyer (and all intellectual property rights in the same) will, unless agreed otherwise, be the property of BALCONETTE.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">4.3 BALCONETTE will confirm to the Buyer the amount of any increase in&nbsp;BALCONETTE&#39;s&nbsp;prices, necessary to comply with the Buyer&#39;s specifications. Quantity increases whether in number of units or size shall be deemed to increase in a proportionate rate to the prices on the Buyers Order without the need of resubmitting a new Buyers Order for confirmation.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">4.4 BALCONETTE will be under no liability for, and the Buyer will fully indemnify BALCONETTE against, any awards, costs, claims, damages, demands, expenses, losses, or other liabilities ( howsoever incurred) which arise in respect of; a) any and all infringement of any intellectual property rights of any third party which may arise as a result of BALCONETTE supplying Goods (or Services) which conform with such specifications of the Buyer as are submitted and agreed in accordance with this Clause; and: b) any errors in Goods which conform with samples previously approved or accepted by the Buyer.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. PERFORMANCE</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">7.1 No period stipulated for delivery shall commence until all specification details have been agreed and payment has been made and cleared with&nbsp;BALCONETTE&#39;s&nbsp;bankers.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">7.4 If BALCONETTE exercises their right of suspension, the Buyer may cancel any remaining part of the Contract conditional on the Buyer paying expenses incurred by BALCONETTE to date and&nbsp;BALCONETTE&#39;s&nbsp;fair charges. BALCONETTE shall have no liability for any such suspension and on any such cancellation, whether by BALCONETTE or by the Buyer. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Buyer from his obligation to make payments under the Contract.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">7.6 Delivery of ordered goods is deemed to have taken place 2 working days after despatch from BALCONETTE&#39;s&nbsp;works.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8. BREAKAGES, SHORTAGES AND OTHER CLAIMS</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">8.1 Without prejudice to clause 14.3, the Buyer shall have 30 days following delivery to inspect the Goods.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">8.4 The BUYER is advised not to book or arrange installation before the Goods arrive and have been inspected by the BUYER. BALCONETTE shall have no liability for any costs arising out of delays, non-delivery or shortage in delivery (subject to consigning the correct quantity of Goods for delivery) deterioration or damage in transit.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9. RETURNS AND RESTOCKING CHARGES</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Except in the case of faulty Goods, BALCONETTE will not normally accept any returns of Goods as these are manufactured to each Buyer&rsquo;s specification.&nbsp; If, exceptionally, BALCONETTE does agree to Goods being returned, the Buyer shall pay a handling and restocking charge to cover administration and inspection charges involved in accepting the Goods back.

The Buyer is responsible for the safe return of the Goods in an undamaged state. BALCONETTE will inspect any returned goods and at its sole discretion determine if they can be accepted.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">10.6 The Buyer shall not be entitled to pledge or in any way charge by way of security for any indebtedness any of the Goods which remain the property of BALCONETTE but if the Buyer does so (or if the Buyer becomes or is declared insolvent (or being an individual, is declared bankrupt) or convenes a meeting of or proposes any arrangement or composition with its creditors or is subject to an order or resolution for winding up (except for the purposes of a solvent reconstruction or amalgamation) or suffers or permits any equivalent step to be taken in any jurisdiction) all money owing by the Buyer to BALCONETTE Shall (without prejudice to any other right or remedy of BALCONETTE) forthwith become due and payable.</p>
